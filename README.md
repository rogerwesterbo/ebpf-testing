# eBPF TCP Connection Monitor

A multi-architecture eBPF application that monitors TCP connections and exports metrics to Prometheus. This tool uses a kernel probe (kprobe) to track `tcp_connect()` calls and counts them per process ID (PID).

## Features

- **eBPF-based monitoring**: Minimal overhead kernel-space monitoring
- **Multi-architecture support**: Builds for AMD64, ARM64, ARM, and RISC-V
- **Prometheus integration**: Exports metrics on `:9090/metrics`
- **Container-ready**: Optimized Docker builds for multiple platforms
- **Kubernetes deployment**: Helm charts included

## Architecture Support

This project supports building and running on multiple architectures:

| Architecture  | Docker Platform | Makefile Target     | Status       |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| AMD64/x86_64  | `linux/amd64`   | `TARGET_ARCH=x86`   | âœ… Supported |
| ARM64/AArch64 | `linux/arm64`   | `TARGET_ARCH=arm64` | âœ… Supported |
| ARM32         | `linux/arm/v7`  | `TARGET_ARCH=arm`   | âœ… Supported |
| RISC-V 64     | `linux/riscv64` | `TARGET_ARCH=riscv` | âœ… Supported |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **For Docker builds**: Docker with buildx support
- **For local builds**: Go 1.25+, Clang, LLVM, and Linux kernel headers (or use Docker on macOS)
- **For Kubernetes**: kubectl access to a cluster with eBPF support
- **For debugging**: VS Code with Go extension

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build for your current platform
docker build -t ebpf-tcp-monitor .

# Run the container (requires privileged mode for eBPF)
docker run --rm --privileged --pid=host \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  ebpf-tcp-monitor
```

### Quick Debug in Kubernetes (3 Steps)

Want to debug with breakpoints in VS Code? It's easy:

```bash
# 1. Start the debug environment (one command)
./scripts/debug-k8s.sh
```

This builds, deploys, and starts port-forwarding. Keep this terminal open!

```
# 2. In VS Code: Press F5 â†’ Select "Attach to Kubernetes Pod"
```

```
# 3. Set breakpoints and debug!
# Try: pkg/ebpf/manager.go:40 or pkg/metrics/collector.go:85
```

**Debug Controls**: F5 (continue), F10 (step over), F11 (step into), Shift+F5 (stop)

When done: `Ctrl+C` on the debug script, then run `./scripts/cleanup-debug.sh`

> ðŸ“š For detailed debugging guide, see [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#debugging](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#debugging)

### Multi-Platform Docker Builds

```bash
# Setup buildx (one-time setup)
docker buildx create --use

# Build for multiple architectures
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 \
  -t your-registry/ebpf-tcp-monitor:latest \
  --push .

# Build for specific architecture
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t ebpf-tcp-monitor:arm64 .
```

### Local Development

#### Building the eBPF Program

```bash
cd eBPF/

# Build for current architecture (x86 default)
make

# Build for ARM64
make TARGET_ARCH=arm64

# Build for ARM32
make TARGET_ARCH=arm

# Build for RISC-V
make TARGET_ARCH=riscv

# See all options
make help
```

#### Building the Go Application

```bash
# Build for current platform
go build -o agent ./cmd/agent

# Cross-compile for ARM64
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o agent-arm64 ./cmd/agent
```

## Usage

### Running Locally

```bash
# Ensure you have the eBPF object file
cd eBPF && make && cd ..

# Run the agent (requires root privileges)
sudo ./agent
```

### Accessing Metrics and Health Checks

Once running, the application exposes multiple endpoints:

**Metrics (Port 9090):**

```
http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

**Health Checks (Port 8080):**

```
http://localhost:8080/readiness  # Kubernetes readiness probe
http://localhost:8080/liveness   # Kubernetes liveness probe
http://localhost:8080/health     # Detailed health information (JSON)
```

**Example outputs:**

_Metrics endpoint:_

```
# HELP tcp_connects_by_pid Number of tcp_connect() calls observed per PID
# TYPE tcp_connects_by_pid gauge
tcp_connects_by_pid{comm="curl",pid="1234"} 5
tcp_connects_by_pid{comm="firefox",pid="5678"} 12
```

_Health endpoint:_

```json
{ "ready": true, "alive": true, "timestamp": 1730316000 }
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
# Install using Helm
helm install ebpf-tcp-monitor ./charts/ebpf-testing

# Or apply directly
kubectl apply -f charts/ebpf-testing/templates/
```

## How It Works

1. **eBPF Program** (`tcpconnect.bpf.c`):

   - Attaches a kprobe to the kernel's `tcp_connect()` function
   - Counts connection attempts per PID in a BPF hash map
   - Runs in kernel space with minimal overhead

2. **User-space Agent** (`cmd/agent/main.go`):

   - Loads the compiled eBPF program into the kernel
   - Polls the BPF map every 5 seconds
   - Resolves PIDs to process names via `/proc/<pid>/comm`
   - Exports data as Prometheus metrics on port 9090
   - Provides Kubernetes health checks on port 8080

3. **Multi-Architecture Build**:
   - Dockerfile uses Docker's automatic platform detection
   - Makefile supports parameterized architecture builds
   - Proper kernel headers installed for each platform

## Development

For detailed development information, see the **[Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)**.

### Quick Development Setup

```bash
# Setup development environment
make dev-setup

# Build everything
make build-all

# Run tests and checks
make test lint

# Show architecture support info
make arch-info
```

### Adding New Architectures

For complete instructions on adding support for new architectures, see the [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#adding-support-for-new-architecture).

Quick overview:

1. Update `eBPF/Makefile` with new architecture mapping
2. Update `Dockerfile` with architecture-specific build steps
3. Test the build: `docker build --platform linux/new_arch .`

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting information, see the **[Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#troubleshooting)**.

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: eBPF requires root privileges or CAP_BPF capability
2. **Program Load Failed**: Ensure kernel supports eBPF and has necessary features
3. **Architecture Mismatch**: Verify the eBPF program was built for the correct architecture

### Quick Debug Commands

```bash
# Check eBPF program info
sudo bpftool prog list

# Verify loaded maps
sudo bpftool map list

# Check kernel eBPF support
zgrep CONFIG_BPF /proc/config.gz
```
